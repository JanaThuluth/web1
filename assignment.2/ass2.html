        <h1>Jana Thuluth</h1>
        <p>"My name is Jana Thuluth, and I am studying computer science with the goal of becoming a world-class
            programmer.
            I enjoy shopping, cooking, and playing handball. One of my greatest achievements is memorizing the entire
            Quran and mastering its recitation rules,
            an experience that has taught me patience and discipline in pursuing my goals."</p>
